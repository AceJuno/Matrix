# Matrix
This is simulation of "matrix effect" (random letters dropping) in C, on linux  using curses.h
I added the .cbp file because I used codeblocks to write it, but you can use only .c and .h files to run it. 
Main() is contained in Projekt.
Also there is makefile so you can run it from Linux console.
Remember that it is written using curses.h library so you need to have it installed.
